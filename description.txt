Simulates a scaling mana cost on the Laser Drill for use as a New Game + bonus tool. Also adds a right click that swaps it into a hammer. Cost increases the closer you get to the underworld, and decreases when you kill bosses(Eye of Cthulu, Skeletron, Wall of Flesh, and disables completely upon defeating Plantera.)
